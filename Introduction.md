#Team Charter
Charter
● Produce systems that can respond to the environment using serial sensing and
actuation.
● Being able to produce a network of digital sensors and being able to apply that
data.
● Being able to make a complex system in a mobile/carry-on fashion
● A system of subsystems that will actually integrate with one another, and allow
for communication between the systems.
● We will work on a system of productivity to ensure deadlines are met.
● We will have an interdependency system between team members for each
system. This will entail a main and secondary person on each subsystem.
Mission Statement
Our team is tasked with making a mobile weather station, with applications of at least two
sensors, switching regulator, and motor articulation dependent on sensor input. Success in this
project will rely on our understanding of our device, and its several parts even though it’s
assigned to one member, each member should have some hand in helping between integration
and overall device readiness of its subsystems. Success will be measured through creation of a
robust, high quality device with straightforward and convenient operation for the end user.
