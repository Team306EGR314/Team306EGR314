## Product Concept Sketches

# Concept 1

<img src="Concept idea 1.png">

This is our 1st concept of the Mobile Weather station. This is our bare bones of what we want in terms of mobility and design, This would be a simple pill device that 
would house the necessary parts that would be included in the device. Such as the brush motors, and a 3.3V power supply. The overall design was open ended, but my main 
inspiration for this was certain weather probes that have a very cylindrical or pill shape which allows for minimal wind resistance and overall protection of the 
device if it ever encountered outside damage.












# Concept 2

In our second concept design, we propose utilizing a box shaped hanging weather station. This will utilize a rechargeable and replaceable 3.6v battery platform 
for power. It will monitor temperature and humidity actively, and vent to the atmosphere to regulate internal temperature and humidity for our end user based upon 
their settings. It will showcase a welded steel frame that will be line-x coated for superior durability. It will have a lexan window encasing the electronics that 
will be removable to change batteries, and access all electronic components for any necessary maintenance. On the weather station, simple controls for operation will 
be located such as power, reset, and accompanying them will be a status led for the weather station depending on which mode it is in (open or closed). It will have the 
ability to be hung by incorporating a braided steel cable from the top. It uses an internal duct to house the sensors that are actively monitoring their respective 
data. At the top of this duct will be a door that opens controlled by a simple 3.6v brushless motor. This door will allow the vent to go into a form of ducting that 
will connect the weather station to the atmosphere. This ducting will be completely removable and work in conjunction with the weather station.


# Concept 3

This design was based on the idea of a “thermometer” on a stick. Using the arm pictured above the device would send a signal out to the motor which would swing the arm 
back and forth. This would be the starting point for our readings, and when the arm stops will be the ending of our readings. The box would be the main housing for the 
electronics. (This will store the Battery, Regulators, and Motor.) Our sensors are located on the end of the arm. This idea is meant to be placed down like in a garden 
or greenhouse, and you could get readings at any point from something like your phone. You would be able to send a signal from an app or something which would tell the 
motor to do a swing and take a measure. The measurements given back to you would give you temperature and humidity readings.

# Our Process
  
  
  
 We had each put some contribution in each of the designs but each design can be credited (in order) to 1 Jedriq Ventura, 2 Samuel Stiffler, 3 Nathan Hoge. Dylan made the contribution of explaining our ideas, and getting them onto the github.
 
 For brainstorming we had given a couple thoughts based on what we had seen in the previous user needs assignment. Concept one was a pill 
 shape that was wind resistant, and it would be super portable, it was based on the beats pill speaker. Concept 2 is a latern style 
 hanger, this was inspired by a humming bird feeder. This would be able to hang in any green house and stays in place collecting 
 information. Concept 3 was an off the wall idea of a "wagging thermometer" this would collect information by waving the arm and starting 
 the collection and ending the collection at the end of the arms path.

It was better to have the ideas but holding to them was way harder. Because we had to make choices based on what is and isnt important. For instance each device is suited for different environments, concept 1 would be on the go, concept 2 would be a hang and stay, finally concept 3 would be a place and sit.
