*Fig. 17  Software Proposal*

When the device turns on according to our proposal, it will initialize its systems, and ready its peripherals. After that it will 
first try to address the separate devices attached. If the device canâ€™t connect to the separate devices it will keep trying to call 
to them. When the device does connect it will measure the temperature and humidity and decide what to tell the motor. A ( Turn and 
open the hatch) or B (Keep it closed). The device will then keep refreshing till any changes.
